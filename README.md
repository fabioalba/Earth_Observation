# Earth_Observation

Repository containing Earth Observation satellite data analysis projects.

At the moment, a notebook about my hometown area seen from the "eyes" of Sentinel-2 satellites, part of the ESA Copernicus constellation.

Guidelines:
- data are accessed through APIs;
- code is set to consider cloud-free images;
- whenever possible, areas are cut out on administrative boundaries (State, Region, Province, Municipality).
